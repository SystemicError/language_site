pick one
Yes
No
Yes (if they pick any answer from question2.1 except option 3 "between 12pm and 4pm" or option 6 "between 12am and 4am") or No (if they pick "between 12pm and 4pm" or "between 12am and 4am")
Look at the paragraph 1 again. When do circadian rhythms create our strongest sleep drive?  Is this time different from when you are alert, or is it the same?
